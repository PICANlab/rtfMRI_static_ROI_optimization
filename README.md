This repository provides MATLAB code to compute static ROI correlations between real-time fMRI (RTP) signals and post-processed AFNI data. 
The main function identifies the ROI mask that maximizes correlation with the participant's neurofeedback signal, enabling optimized ROI selection for subsequent analyses.
Designed to be modular, the function works with 4-D AFNI datasets and any set of candidate ROI masks.
